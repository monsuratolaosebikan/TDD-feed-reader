#Test Driven Development FeedReader Project
In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and used the Jasmine Test Framework 
to test the functionality of the RSS Reader. 

The tests included :
<ul>
<li>Checking if there was a defined name and url for each feed</li>
<li>Checking if the menu was hidden upon opening the webpage</li>
<li>Checking if the menu open and closed when the menu icon was clicked</li>
<li>Checking if an asynchronous function successfully changed the html content dynamically when called</li>
</ul>
